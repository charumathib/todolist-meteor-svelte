# todolist-meteor-svelte

This todo app was built using Meteor and Svelte based on [this](https://svelte-tutorial.meteor.com/simple-todos/) tutorial and [deployed on Galaxy](https://todo-charu.meteorapp.com/). Simply type todos into the input box and click "Enter" to submit them. Click the checkbox next to a todo to mark it complete, and the "x" to delete a todo. Completed todos can be shown or hidden by clicking the "Hide Completed" button.
